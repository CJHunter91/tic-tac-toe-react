This app creates a basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe (Nought and Crosses) using React with JS and running on an express server.

Splitting the models into a different folder allowed us to run unit tests testing the game logic before integrating it into the React components.


Installation Process
* Use node package manager to install dependencies in the root directory.
* Run the server in the root directory via npm Start.
* Run webpack in client using npm run build.
